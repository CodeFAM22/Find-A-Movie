## Notes

During the 1st Milestone of the Find-A-Movie project, our primary focus was on ideation and idea evaluation. We engaged in thorough brainstorming sessions to explore various app concepts, followed by a rigorous evaluation process to identify the most promising idea. Additionally, we dedicated time to creating initial prototypes, refining our understanding of user interface design and app navigation.
