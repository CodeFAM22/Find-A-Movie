## Build Notes

During the development of the Find-A-Movie app, we focused on creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily search for movies and access detailed information 
about them. We enhanced our understanding of RecyclerViews by implementing them again after our previous class project or lab. We learned how to integrate the TMDb API to fetch 
movie data and display it within our app. Throughout the process, we gained valuable experience in working with APIs, handling user interactions, and designing intuitive user 
interfaces.
